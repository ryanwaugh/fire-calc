# fire-calc

A simple JavaFX app to calculate your FIRE target amount*, and visualize your savings grow over time.

`FIRE Target = 25 * Yearly spend in retirement`

*This is considered to be an amount of stocks and/or bonds from which you could *theoretically* draw/sell 4% of the target amount every year throughout *any* length of retirement.
